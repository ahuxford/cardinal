- Added the ability to round corners of the [NekMeshGenerator](/meshgenerators/NekMeshGenerator.md) mesh generator, such as for fitting corners of a ducted bundle to a circular radius of curvature.
- Allow users to customize the amount of NekRS scratch space allocated with the `n_usrwrk_slots` parameter on the problem class. Previously, we would always allocated 7 slots, which can constitue a lot of memory for large problems (when most users don't need to have that much anyways).
- Allow NekRS passive scalars to be output to the mesh mirror for fast visualization and use in other MOOSE systems.
