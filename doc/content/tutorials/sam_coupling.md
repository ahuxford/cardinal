# Tutorial 4: Multiscale Coupling of NekRS and SAM for Primary Loop Modeling

This tutorial describes how to couple NekRS to a System Thernal Hydraulics (STH) code
with mass, momentum, and scalar coupling by exchanging boundary conditions
for velocity, pressure, and passive scalar. In particular, this tutorial
couples a NekRS RANS model to an STH code for improved modeling of
scalar mixing and transport within a system with recirculaiton of scalar.

For a real-world application of the coupling, we will utilize the double T-junction
scalar mixing experiment from Bertolotto et al.
(TODO: add reference to Bertolotto's original double T paper).

For a complete description of the experiment, the authors
direct readers to Bertolotto et al. (2009) and Bertolotto
(2011), but a brief description is given here. The double
T-junction‚Äôs setup is shown in [doublet], and it contains two
loops joined by a double T-junction where one loop serves
as the main line and one the recirculation line. The main
line enforces a set flow rate into the double T-junction, and
the recirculation line has a pump forcing flow back into the
double T-junction. The system is operated at atmospheric
conditions with tap water as the working fluid. A tracer
(deionized water) is injected within the side loop, and its
concentration is measured at three different locations using
wire mesh sensors (WM). The flow rate is controlled in each
loop to maintain the same Reynolds number of 23,750.

# NekRS Model Details

NekRS is used to model the double T-junction where
3D mixing effects are most present, and the NekRS model
employs a unsteady-RANS simulation with its ùëò-ùúè model
along with an additional passive scalar for modeling the
tracer‚Äôs transport. An all-hex mesh is generated using Gmsh
(Geuzaine and Remacle (2009)) while ensuring the wall
y+ is below 1, and [doublet_nek_mesh] shows the NekRS mesh used.
The NekRS predicted flow field is shown in [doublet_nek_flow] with
boundaries labeled.

Boundary conditions set in the NekRS model are listed in [table-nek-bcs].
The NekRS model‚Äôs domain was extended at both outlets to ensure there‚Äôs no reversed
flow at these boundaries. The term ‚ÄúDeveloped‚Äù in [table-nek-bcs]
refers to a fully-developed profile coming from a periodic
simulation for the same operational Reynolds number as the
experiment.
